expander.vim requires Vim's Python interface-----

expander expands abbreviations. Its abbreviations can take arguments that are repeated in the expanded text. For instance, for C++ iterators you can type:

@fib@vector<char>@vec<C-e>

and this expands to:

for(vector<char>::iterator i = vec.begin(); i != vec.end(); ++i) {
    *
}

With your cursor in the place of the *. Defining new abbreviations is easy. The above one was defined like this:

"fib": """
for($1::iterator i = $2.begin(); i != $2.end(); ++i) {
$#$0
}"""

When expander expands this, it replaces the string $# with spaces equal to your shiftwidth, it puts the cursor at $0, and it replaces $1, $2, etc, with the first, second, etc, arguments.
